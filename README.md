# Deep Purple

This repository contains the frontend for the **Deep Purple** project, a text analysis software that deciphers emotions in client communications. The backend is built using Spring Boot, packaged and deployed on AWS beanstalk and connects to a RDS database.

## Features

- RESTful API for managing communications.
- Database connectivity RDS postgre
- Hibernate for ORM support.
- Caching support using Caffeine.
- Reactive programming support with Spring WebFlux.
- gpt-4o-mini API for analysis.
- Fully cloud hosted

## Getting Started

The application is hosted on https://app.purpleproj.click

Operations:

Save: Input content and select the "Save" operation to store a new communication.

Update: Provide the communication ID and new content to update an existing communication.

Delete: Enter the communication ID to delete a specific communication.

Get All: Retrieve and display all communications stored in the backend.

Currently still in testing phase, so backend is down at the moment to cut costs.
